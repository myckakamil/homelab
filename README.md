I started this project with the goal of managing my entire homelab infrastructure as Infrastructure as Code using Ansible, Terraform, and other automation tools.
While working on it, I learned a lot about automation, orchestration, and infrastructure design but I also realized that trying to build everything at once was a bit too ambitious for my current skill level.

Instead of continuing to patch this repo together, I’ve decided to split it into smaller, more focused Ansible roles and playbooks, and postpone the Terraform part until I feel more confident with Ansible, Bash and Containerization.

Additionally, I’m in the process of migrating my infrastructure from Proxmox to XCP-ng. Reworking everything here to fit that change would be unnecessarily complex, so I’ll start fresh and apply what I’ve learned to build something cleaner and more maintainable.

This repository will remain as a record of my first serious attempt at managing my homelab through code. Valuable learning experience that I’ll definitely return to later, once I’ve mastered the tools better.
